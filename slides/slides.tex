\frametitle{Problems facing modern compute}
  \framesubtitle{}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The free lunch afforded by hardware improvements over years
      is coming to an end
    \item Hardwares are designed first and complying softwares to support
      them after it.
    \item New and creative architectures need to be designed along with the
      softwares abstractions to use them. 
  \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\frametitle{Overview of Modern Compute}
\framesubtitle{}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item An average motherboard has a CPU and optionally a GPU
    \item In specialized domains, one may find ASICs being used (for eg, 
      ML acceleration)
    \item ASICs are pretty cool (and fast) and solve domain specific problems
      that CPU/GPUs may not be able to solve, but are they for everyone?
    \item For starters, they are expensive to engineer and require a team
      of expert hardware engineers to be designed and fabricated
    \item Once that's done, expert systems software engineers are required
      to make the ASIC usable/compatible with the existing operating systems.
    \item A lot of hardwork, definitely not for everyone.  As a result, ASICs are far and few
    \item Should modern compute be restricted to CPUs/GPUs and a handful
      of ASICs?
    \item What about the problems where none of existing compute suffices?
  \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

  \frametitle{Hard-to-solve Problems for Modern Compute}
  \framesubtitle{Example 1}
  \textbf{Problems involving many peripherals as well as compute}

  For example, \\

  An embedded application that uses object detection to find
  objects in a line of sight and responds to it by driving many motors in
  real time needs heavy compute (for OD) and flexible IO to be able to 
  drive all the motors reliably. \\

  Existing solution would involve usign a GPU for ML workload, an
  driving the motors from a CPU. A CPU may or may not have as many IOs
  as required, in which case an IO expander may have to be set up.

  \framesubtitle{Example 2}
  \textbf{Unusual Representation of Numbers}

  Quantization is a technique of reducing precision of numbers at the loss of
  accuracy. Quantization is used extensively to speed up Neural Network
  inference. New techniques such as heterogenous quantization of layers (i.e.
  different bit-widths of numbers at layer granularity), odd-number quantization
  (such as 9-bit numbers), ternary computers etc. pose a significant challenge
  for existing fixed-bit-width computers.

  \textbf{New Architectures/Solutions for Old Problems}

  Kolmogorov-Arnold networks propose an alternative to MLPs (which is
  at the core of machine learning today). Quick and cheap inclusion of KANs into
  accelerators could help. TODO: write more

  \frametitle{We can have our cake and eat it to}
  \framesubtitle{}
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item Strengths of existing compute is known. We would like
          to have these strengths in our systems and bring reconfigurable
          heterogenous compute to tackle the weaknesses. 
        \item We say, \textbf{It is possible to solve problems that are
          insufficiently solved by existing compute whilst keeping existing
          infrastructure (TODO: rephrase)}
        \item The goal is to \textcolor{green}{assist} existing compute not
          \textcolor{red}{replace}.
      \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

  \frametitle{Setting the stage}
  \framesubtitle{}
    Two key ideas:
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item Reconfiguration: The process through which a "reconfigurable
      processor" is re-programmed to implement a new circuit
        \item Heterogeneity: A system must include processors of different 
          capacities/abilites well integrated together.
      \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\frametitle{Reconfigurability: An Introduction to FPGAs}
\framesubtitle{}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item FPGAs are a grid of cells that can be reprogrammed to implement
      any circuit. 
    \item Digital circuits consist of gates (that implement logic) and
      connections (that connect gates to each other).
    \item FPGAs, at the core, consist of SRAM cells (that implement the
      functionality of gates by storing their truth-tables in SRAM cells) and
      programmable interconnect (implemented via switch boxes) that allow
      connections
    \item Circuits for FPGAs are described using Hardware Descriptions Languages
      (HDLs) such as Verilog, VHDL.
    \item High level description of a circuit is compiled into real hardware
      (i.e. a representation that only uses FPGA primitives) by a "compiler"
  \end{enumerate}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Key problems with reconfigurable-heterogenous computing}
\framesubtitle{}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item To implement a reconfigurable heterogenous computer with FPGAs,
      the problems are two-fold:
    \item Problem 1: Using FPGAs with traditional softwares are in-convenient.
    \item Problem 2: Writing new hardwares for FPGAs, implementing custom solutions is
      tedious with a very steep learning curve, often times requiring 
      domain expertise.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Problem 1: Programming model for FPGAs}
\framesubtitle{}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item GPUs enjoy a concrete and abstract programming model
    \item No true industry grade programming model exists for FPGAs
    \item There's OpenCL support for FPGAs. But that involves treating
      FPGAs like an ASIC.
    \item A true programming model for FPGAs would heavily exploit
      reconfigurability

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Realizing this goal}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Realizing this goal requires designing and implementation from
      first principles
    \item To achieve this, we designed our own hardware: Vaaman
    \item To understand the nature of applications (in the sense of what
      bottlenecks exist and whether or not a certain application would
      benefit from reconfigurable-heterogenous architecture), projects have been implemented
    \item These include: Gati (an ML accelerator) and Periplex (a peripheral
      multiplexor)
    \item Discussion on this work follows:
  \end{enumerate}
  \framesubtitle{}
\end{frame}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Implementation: ML Accelerator (Gati)}
  Gati is a set of hardware and software programs that perform CNN
  acceleration with FPGA as a co-processor.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item At the core of gati is a systolic array pipeline based MAC engine
    \item The Gati-ISA is macro (i.e. implements complex operations directly
      like Convolution) instead of breaking them down into primitives
    \item The instructions have almost a one-to-one match with 'layers'
      from a neural network
    \item Assisting this hardware is a Compiler/Runtime.
    \item The compiler does two primary things:
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item Parsing of input data and NN models (protobufs etc.),
          transpositions of kernels to allow contiguos memory access, and generation
          of a byte stream that can be fed to the FPGA
        \item Generating custom hardware for every nn model
      \end{enumerate}
    \item The runtime partitions a network into execute-on-host and
      execute-on-device, re-orders inputs, and offloads computation
      to the FPGA
  \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Gati has an ISA? But you said ISAs are bad?}
  Gati is a testbed for modelling complex problems found in real world.
  At the moment it does and doesn not do many things that we eventually want
  from it.
  For example:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Gati has a hardware generator. If this generator is generalized
      enouugh, we end up solving a part of problem 1.
    \item It still uses an ISA. But its possible to partition an ML
      model so that it can entirely fit into 
      the FPGA hardwired to do only a part of the model followed by
      reconfiguration to execute later parts.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Implementation: Peripheral Multiplexor (Periplex)}
  \framesubtitle{}

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Periplex is a interface translator that allows communication
      between a set of inputs from a set of protocols to a set of outputs
      in another set of protocols
    \item Consider, an application where 2 inputs each from an SPI bus and an
      I2C bus need to drive 2 motors whose controller speaks CAN. Periplex can
      be used to easily make hardware and enable this communication.
    \item Periplex is, in a sense, the swiss army knife of embedded
      communication protocols.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Conclusion}
  \framesubtitle{}

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Reconfigurable architectures can provide a way to solve many problems
      that existing compute struggle with
    \item Reconfigurable architectures as demostrated previously can help
      alleviate von-neumann bottleneck.
  \end{enumerate}
