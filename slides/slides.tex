Abstract

As Moore's law's imminent slow down is in effect, there is a need for innovative
architectures designed from ground-up with both hardware and software in mind.
We describe an architecture along with a family of software programs (compilers
and runtimes) that form the basis of this hardware-software system. Moreover,
interoperation with existing compute infrastructure is proposed. The
architecture at its core executes expected functionality (i.e.  operations
expected to be performed by a traditional processor) not with a fixed
instruction set but by reconfiguring flexible re-programmable hardwares
dynamically at the time of computation. This reconfiguration, driven by a
software compiler specializes the hardware for every function but generalizes
(in the time domain) through re-configuration. In contrast to traditional
cpu-memory back-and-forth dataflow, this architecture exihibits a uni-lateral
flow of data with zero instruction overhead (as a result of there being no
instructions at all) alleviating the von-neumann bottleneck. Additionally,
oppurtunities to improve existing compilers for reconfigurable chips (FPGAs) are
also discussed.

\frametitle{About us}

  Vicharak was founded with the idea: to introduce software-level
  reconfigurability to the hardware world with real parallel machines to enhance
  computing. 

  Our \textbf{goal} is to create consumer and industrial
  computing hardware, as well as an entirely new kind of computing ecosystem
  that can sit on your desk, rest in your palm, or exist in the cloud. 

  For such an ambitious goal, Vicharak is ready to work on every vertical with
  a team of \~{}50 passionate engineers and thinkers deeply entrenched to make this
  vision a reality.

  \framesubtitle{}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The free lunch afforded by hardware improvements over years
      is coming to an end
    \item Hardwares are designed first and complying softwares to support
      them after it.
    \item New and creative architectures need to be designed along with the
      software abstractions to use them. 
  \end{enumerate}

\frametitle{Overview of Modern Compute}
\framesubtitle{}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item An average motherboard has a CPU and optionally a GPU
    \item In specialized domains, one may find ASICs being used (for e.g., 
      ML acceleration)
    \item ASICs are pretty cool (and fast) and solve domain specific problems
      that CPU/GPUs may not be able to solve, but are they for everyone?
    \item For starters, they are expensive to engineer and require a team
      of expert hardware engineers to be designed and fabricated
    \item Once that's done, expert systems software engineers are required
      to make the ASIC usable/compatible with the existing operating systems.
    \item A lot of hardwork, definitely not for everyone.  As a result, ASICs are far and few
    \item Should modern compute be restricted to CPUs/GPUs and a handful
      of ASICs?
    \item What about the problems where none of existing compute suffices?
  \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

  \frametitle{Hard-to-solve Problems for Modern Compute}
  \framesubtitle{Example 1}
  \textbf{Problems involving many peripherals and compute}

  For example, \\

  An embedded application that uses object detection to find
  objects in a line of sight and responds to it by driving many motors in
  real time needs heavy compute (for OD) and flexible I/O to be able to 
  drive all the motors reliably. \\

  Existing solution would involve using a GPU for ML workload, and
  driving the motors from a CPU. A CPU may or may not have as many I/Os
  as required, in which case an I/O expander or an ASIC may have to be set up.

  \frametitle{Hard-to-solve Problems for Modern Compute}
  \framesubtitle{Example 2}
  \textbf{Unusual Representation of Numbers}

  Quantization is a technique of reducing precision of numbers at the loss of
  accuracy. Quantization is used extensively to speed up Neural Network
  inference. New techniques such as heterogeneous quantization of layers (i.e.
  different bit-widths of numbers at layer granularity), odd-number quantization
  (such as 9-bit numbers), ternary computers etc. pose a significant challenge
  for existing fixed-bit-width computers. 

  See \cite{coelho21}.

  \framesubtitle{Example 3}
  \textbf{New Architectures/Solutions for Old Problems}

  New solutions to old problems are those that are fundamentally different to
  all existing solutions. For example, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) propose
  an alternative to MLPs (which is at the core of machine learning today). KANs
  replace the static parameter of MLPs with a learnt spline function. Wrappers
  can be built around existing hardware to execute KANs too, but since its
  different on a fundamental level, dedicated hardwares would be beneficial.

  \textbf{Power-efficiency without sacrifices}

  CPUs/GPUs sacrifice power efficiency for generality. 

  Unlike general purpose chips, on FPGAs you only get what you need. As a
  result, the overall power efficiency of dedicated hardware tends to be
  higher than general purpose processors. 

  FPGAs offer a fair middle-ground in terms of power efficiency. FPGAs
  can have flexibility of CPUs but with the power efficiency that they possess
  because of re-programmability.

  Introduction To Reconfigurable And Heterogeneous Computing
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Setting the stage}
  \framesubtitle{}
    Two key ideas:
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item Reconfiguration: The process through which a "reconfigurable
      processor" is re-programmed to implement a new circuit
        \item Heterogeneity: The idea that a system must include processors of different 
          capacities/abilities well integrated together.
      \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Reconfigurability: An Introduction to FPGAs}
\framesubtitle{}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item FPGAs are a grid of cells that can be reprogrammed to implement
      any circuit. 
    \item Digital circuits consist of gates (that implement logic) and
      connections (that connect gates to each other).
    \item FPGAs popularly consist of SRAM cells (that implement the
      functionality of gates by storing their truth-tables in it) and
      programmable interconnect (implemented via switch boxes) that allow
      connections
    \item Circuits for FPGAs are described using Hardware Descriptions Languages
      (HDLs) such as Verilog, VHDL.
    \item High level description of a circuit is compiled into real hardware
      (i.e. a representation that only uses FPGA primitives) by a "compiler"
  \end{enumerate}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Key Problems With Reconfigurable-Heterogenous Computing}
\framesubtitle{}
    To implement a reconfigurable heterogeneous computer with FPGAs,
      the problems are two-fold:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Problem 1: Using FPGAs with traditional software is in-convenient.
    \item Problem 2: Writing new hardwares for FPGAs, implementing custom solutions is
      tedious with a very steep learning curve, often times requiring 
      domain expertise.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
\frametitle{Problem 1: Programming model for FPGAs}
\framesubtitle{}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item GPUs enjoy a concrete (in the sense of coverage) and abstract (in
      terms of usability) programming model
    \item No true industry grade programming model exists for FPGAs
    \item There's OpenCL support for FPGAs. But that involves treating
      FPGAs like an ASIC.
    \item A true programming model for FPGAs would heavily exploit
      reconfigurability

  Figure b) is a flow computer where the

  way desired.

  \frametitle{Comparison of a Reconfigurable-Heterogenous Programming Model with a Von-Neumann
  computer}
  \framesubtitle{}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item There are \textcolor{red}{no instructions} as the hardware
  is configured to a desired operation. Data flows in and out
  of the chip transformed. 

\item It could be said from the previous slide that the reconfigurable style of
  architecture has no Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) (hence the title
  of this talk). 

\item "What to do with data" is a part of the hardware, instead
  of being attached with the data in the form of instructions. It's the
  only thing that it does.
  \end{itemize}

  Following are a few examples of reconfigurable no-ISA architecture. They
  include a JPEG encoder and a CNN accelerator:

  Images (according to the pre-process pipeline of a network) flow
  in, each layer manipulates and passes its computation to the
  hardware after it and end-results are returned by the last
  block.

  \frametitle{Observation on flow-based computers}
  \framesubtitle{}
  \begin{enumerate}
      
    \item Hardwares for a problem are generated by a "Compiler" from a high-level
      specification that describes connection of coarse functions.
    \item Any coarse hardware can be programmatically plucked and placed in a
      different setting thanks to the compilers ability to reason with hardware
      connections.
    \item Flow based computer exhibit a more functional approach towards
      computation
    \item On a coarser scale, purity of computation is maintained as hardware
      blocks do not depend on a global state to execute

  Describes an application that takes raw inputs from camera, passes it through
  a JPEGEncoder that stops after the DCT step, executes ML inference on the
  outputs of the encoder, returns the results on the LVDS.

  \frametitle{Optimization oppurtunity for EDA compilers}
  \framesubtitle{}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Our DSL compiler connects hardware together. The mapping phase
      of hardware generation can be completely bypassed if The compiler can
      be designed to operate on netlists directly instead of verilog.
    \item The mapping process involves, among many steps, a phase where it looks
      for a minimal boolean expression. In iterative write-compile-debug loops
      entire hardware may not change frequently so their resulting minimal
      boolean expressions can be cached and further sped up by performing a
      look up in this cache instead of searching all over again.
    \item Routing can be designed to make use of GPUs.

  Work Done Towards Implementation
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Realizing this goal}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Realizing this goal requires design and implementation from
      first principles
    \item To achieve this, we designed our own hardware: Vaaman. 
    \item Vaaman is a reconfigurable heterogenous computer.
    \item To understand the nature of applications (in the sense of what
      bottlenecks exist and whether or not a certain application would
      benefit from reconfigurable-heterogenous architecture), projects have been implemented
    \item These include: Gati (an ML accelerator) and Periplex (a peripheral
      generator)
    \item Discussion on this work follows:
  \end{enumerate}
  \framesubtitle{}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{ML Accelerator (Gati)}
  Gati is a set of hardware and software programs that perform CNN
  acceleration with FPGA as a co-processor on Vaaman.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item At the core of Gati is a systolic array pipeline based MAC engine
    \item \textcolor{red}{Gati has an ISA}. The Gati-ISA is a macro-ISA (i.e. implements complex operations directly
      like Convolution) instead of breaking them down into primitives
    \item The instructions have almost a one-to-one match with 'layers'
      from a neural network
    \item Assisting this hardware is a Compiler/Runtime.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{ML Accelerator (Gati)}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The compiler does two primary things:
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item Parsing of input data and NN models (protobufs (ONNX) etc.),
          transpositions of kernels to allow contiguous memory access on the 
          FPGA, and generation
          of a byte stream that can be fed to the FPGA
        \item Generating custom hardware for every nn model
      \end{enumerate}
    \item The runtime partitions a network into execute-on-host and
      execute-on-device, re-orders inputs, and offloads computation
      to the FPGA
  \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Gati has an ISA? But you said ISAs are bad?}
  Gati is a testbed for modelling complex problems found in real world.
  At the moment it does and does not do many things that we eventually want
  from it.
  For example:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Gati has a hardware generator. If this generator is generalized
      enough, we end up solving a part of problem 1.
    \item It still uses an ISA. But its possible to partition an ML
      model so that it can entirely fit into 
      the FPGA hardwired to do only a part of the model followed by
      reconfiguration to execute later parts.

  \frametitle{Periplex - On-the-Fly Peripheral Generation}
  \framesubtitle{Problem}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Hardware peripherals are limited by fabrication at the ASIC level or
      in MCUs and MPUs.
    \item The world is moving towards more complex combinations of physical
      peripherals, instead of just (2 UARTs, 4 SPI, etc.).
    \item Due to ASIC manufacturing costs and time, the hardware peripherals’
      average innovation/scale period from concept to fabricated chip and to
      consumers is around 2-3 years.
    \item Emerging embedded industries like drones, autonomous
  vehicles,industrial gateways, robotics require more hardware peripheral
  accessibility and innovation due to real-time operations.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Periplex - On-the-Fly Peripheral Generation}
  \framesubtitle{Solution}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Periplex allows software-defined generation of peripherals on
      reconfigurable hardware (FPGAs) which allows rapid prototyping
      and development hardware supporting newer peripherals in days not years.
    \item Periplex operates on a JSON-driven configuration that specifies 
      what peripherals are needed and how they should be connected, 
      generates FPGA bitstream and uploads it the the FPGA.
    \item Periplex accomodates drivers for these peripherals directly into
      the linux kernel so that it can be accessed through linux APIs easily.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]
  \frametitle{Periplex - On-the-Fly Peripheral Generation}
  \framesubtitle{Solution}
  \begin{enumerate}
     \item Peripherals supported by periplex include (more will be added):
       UART, I2C, CAN, WS28128B (LED), GPIO, PWN, SPI, 1-Wire
     \item Periplex brings 'software updates' to peripherals. Addition of new
       peripherals can be realized into hardware withing minutes. (I3C, I2S,
       PCM etc.)
     \item With Periplex, there's no need to buy new special-purpose
       chips/modules.

  \frametitle{Conclusion}
  \framesubtitle{}

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Reconfigurable architectures can provide a way to solve many problems
      that existing compute struggle with and help alleviate the von-neumann
      bottleneck.
    \item Heterogenous approach of assisting instead of replacing integration of
      new hardwares in systems can allow existing infrastructure to be used.
    \item Two of the biggest problems with achieving this are a) programming
      model that exploits reconfigurability b) fast and flexible hardware
      compilers (EDA tools)
    \item Solutions to problem a) manifest themselves in the form of novel DSLs
      and compiler/runtime toolchains compatible with current
      toolchain/workflows used by CPUs
    \item Solutions to problem b) involve finding optimization oppurtunities
      to speed up EDA tools, making use of modern parallel hardwares such as
      GPU, and other accelerators.
